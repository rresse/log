It was this unnatural kind of growth that--
[14:05:22] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] ? ~Imdrelar seemed completely uneven, giving off an uncanny valley kind of look that made Imdrelar not really appear like an actual person, more like a distorted reflection of himself in a carnival mirror. He didn't respond back to Titania, merely offering a smile--

[14:19:13] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] ~Titania 's stomach rumbles, bile spluttering within. Her skin visibly recoils, a wave of flesh stretching back, drawing her skin taut against the bone. "Do not dare, you repulse me."

As he got closer his smell was a lot more pungent, but unlike what one would expect it wasn't foul, in fact it was sweet, like freshly baked goods, an odd contrast to the--
[14:32:30] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] ? ~Imdrelar unpleasant visual nature of him.
[14:33:09] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] ? ~Imdrelar asks: "Is that all you wished to see? I accept you with all your hives, sickness, and flaws, so why take issue with this?"
[14:34:21] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] ~Titania 's eyes glaze over, nostrils flaring as she's hit with the full overload to her senses. The woman, thin as a twig looks as if she could blow over.

[14:35:08] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] ~Titania says: "I am burdened with the task to unleash you from this hold yet- you.. sadden me. I feel pain. A part of me would leave you here and choose to forget."

[14:38:44] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] ~Titania "YOU DO NEED ME," she wails, her voice splitting into a shrill, high-pitched screech. She lets a burst of arcane energy rip through her throat in turn, spurred on by his audacity to summon another damned treat in front of her-

[14:44:20] [Render thread/INFO]: [CHAT] ~Titania shook her head sharply, a crack sounding from the base of her neck. Resounding. She lofts a single finger, commanding a branch to grip the Thrall's shoulder. At first, gentle, but with its grasp slowly tensing. "Enough of your drivel. I have decided."
